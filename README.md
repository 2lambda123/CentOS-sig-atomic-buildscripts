# sig-atomic-buildscripts

This contains metadata and build scripts for the CentOS Atomic Host
Images.  For more information, see
http://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup/Atomic

### The build process

The scripts used to do nightly builds based on this content are not
quite public yet. By the upcoming CentOS Atomic SIG meeting (Thursday,
April 16) we hope to have these scripts in source control, in the SIG
repo above. The nightly build process will then pull script updates
from the repo for each build. A rough draft of this, along with some
notes:

Currently this process is owned by Karanbir Singh.
