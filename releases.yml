# This file defines promoted releases from smoketested -> alpha, and
# possibly in the future from alpha -> beta.  You can think of this
# as simply a declarative way to manage ostree commits.  See `do-release-tags`.

# To create a new release, find the latest tip of centos-atomic-host/7/x86_64/devel/smoketested;
# I typically do this from inside a VM, so I can test it interactively too:
# $ rpm-ostree rebase centos-atomic-host/7/x86_64/devel/smoketested
# $ ostree show  centos-atomic-host/7/x86_64/devel/smoketested
#
# Then, edit the commit hash and version, and update both below.
